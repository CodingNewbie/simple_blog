        <h4 class="text-center mb-4 fw-normal">Our Mission</h4>
        <p class="lead fw-normal">
            At <strong>Git Happens</strong>, we believe every bug has a story to tell. We're here to share those stories,
            from spectacular fails to epic victories. Our mission is to show that coding isn't just about getting it right
            the first time—it's about the journey of learning, adapting, and yes, sometimes breaking things.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-4 fw-normal">Who We Are</h4>
        <p class="fw-normal">
            We're a team of developers, dreamers, and, most importantly, doers. Founded by a group of friends who met at a hackathon,
            Git Happens has grown into a community for coders by coders. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out,
            there's a place for you here to laugh, learn, and code together.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-4 fw-normal">Why 'Git Happens'?</h4>
        <p class="fw-normal">
            The name "Git Happens" is a playful nod to both the version control system and the unexpected moments that occur
            when pushing code. We've all been there—late-night coding sessions where one wrong command sends you spiraling into
            a coding conundrum. But hey, that's how we learn (and get some of our best stories)!
